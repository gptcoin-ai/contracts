# Smartcontract GPT Coin

#### [[Blog Post]](https://openai.com/blog/procgen-benchmark/) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01588)

GPT Coin was created on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain, which means it uses the standard functionality of BEP-20, not ERC-20, which is used on the Ethereum blockchain. BEP-20 also provides basic functions such as transfer, balanceOf, approve, allowance, and transferFrom, as well as allows for creating custom additional functions and events. Thus, GPT Coin is an innovative token on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain that provides fast and secure transactions using the standard BEP-20 functions and additional features.

"As part of this project, GPT Coin aims to provide transparency regarding the technological components of this cryptocurrency. Therefore, we are publishing a code fragment that is responsible for one of the key functions of the coin. Showing the code allows our users to gain a deeper understanding of the principles of our cryptocurrency and ensure its safety and reliability."

#The uniqueness of GPT COIN
The main advantages of using GPT Coin are high processing speed, adaptability to market changes, and network function enhancement through the use of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the blockchain technology on which GPT Coin is based provides security, transparency, and immutability of transactions.
In the context of research in the field of cryptocurrencies, the main issue is increasing the speed and efficiency of transactions. The use of GPT Coin and its technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, can solve this problem. Moreover, GPT Coin can analyze transaction data and predict future market trends, which helps to increase network efficiency and protection.
Security and protection against hacking and fraud are important factors in cryptocurrencies. Thanks to the blockchain, GPT Coin can guarantee the security of transactions and data integrity, making it reliable and convenient to use.
GPT Coin is an innovative and unique tool in the cryptocurrency and payment system industry. The use of advanced blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies enables high-speed data processing, adaptability to market changes, and improved network functions. Integrating GPT Coin into other projects and systems can significantly simplify their use and expand their functionality. Adding a coin staking feature will create an additional incentive for users to acquire GPT Coin and use it for their payments.
GPT Coin is a unique project thanks to the integration of GPT-4 technology into the blockchain. This makes it possible to create a multi-functional cryptocurrency that can be used in various fields, including business, media, social networks, and others.
Moreover, the uniqueness of the project is confirmed by the fact that many large companies such as DuckDuckGo, Coca Cola, Snapchat, Quizlet, Koo, Shopify, Instacart, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, and Alibaba have already started using OpenAI and ChatGPT in their services to improve efficiency and enhance the user experience. GPT Coin, in turn, offers broader possibilities and new ways of using GPT technology, making it a competitive and promising project in the blockchain and artificial intelligence industry.

This populates the `heist_key_count` info value each time the environment is observed.

If you run the interactive script (making sure that you installed from source), the new keys should appear in the bottom left hand corner:

`python -m procgen.interactive --env-name heist`
